                    Hello! I'm an aspiring backend developer with a passion for building scalable, 
                    efficient systems and clean, well-documented APIs. My journey into software 
                    development started with a curiosity about how web applications work behind the scenes.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I specialize in Node.js and Express for building server-side applications, 
                    but I'm also exploring Python and FastAPI. I believe in writing clean, 
                    maintainable code and following best practices for software architecture.
                </p>
                
                <h3>What I'm Currently Learning:</h3>
                <ul class="learning-list">
                    <li>Advanced Node.js patterns and performance optimization</li>
                    <li>Microservices architecture and message queues (RabbitMQ)</li>
                    <li>Database design and optimization</li>
                    <li>Docker containerization and deployment strategies</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>My Development Philosophy:</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that great software is built on solid foundations. That means clean code, 
                    thorough testing, clear documentation, and systems that are both scalable and maintainable.
